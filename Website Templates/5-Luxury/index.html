    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>For over a century, ÉLÉGANCE has defined the pinnacle of craftsmanship and design. Founded in Geneva in 1912, the house began as a small atelier of horologists and jewellers who refused to compromise on materials or technique. Each piece was—and still is—signed by the artisan who created it.</p>
    <p>Today we remain family-owned and operate from our historic headquarters on the Place du Molard, with salons in Paris, London, and New York. We do not advertise. Our clients find us through referral, and our collections are presented by appointment or at invitation-only events. We believe luxury is not about visibility but about integrity: the integrity of the craft, the materials, and the relationship with those who appreciate it.</p>
    <p>Each piece tells a story of dedication, heritage, and unparalleled quality. When you wear or live with ÉLÉGANCE, you become part of that story.</p>

    <p class="testimonial">"I have collected watches for thirty years. ÉLÉGANCE is the only house where I still feel I am in a conversation with the maker—not a brand. The private viewing in Geneva was an experience unlike any other. Truly exceptional."</p>
    <p class="attribution">— M., Geneva</p>
    <p class="testimonial" style="margin-top:2rem;">"The jewellery I have acquired here will go to my daughter. It is not about the stone size; it is about the integrity of the house and the fact that they remember every piece they have ever made."</p>
